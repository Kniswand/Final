I made my site look as similar to the one provided as nessesary. Many of the link that display subpages upon hovering over them were unnessesary. I did this as I didn't want to get points removed and had no idea on what else to base this assignment upon. Aditionally, the various colors options for the different coffee makers were excluded as they aren't required in the assignement's instructions. However, somthigin additional I did add were the star ratings on the products as well as "sold out" products to simulte the realism of an online site that may be out of stock. The compare feature has also been removed. The color scheme is also identical to that of the one provided, it is rather simple and I like it that way.
